# Task-9
# Random Forest – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective
To build a Random Forest model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and handle imbalanced data effectively.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Synthetic / Kaggle alternative)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded fraud dataset and analyzed class imbalance
2. Separated features and target variable
3. Applied stratified train-test split
4. Trained baseline Logistic Regression model
5. Trained Random Forest classifier
6. Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score
7. Plotted feature importances
8. Compared Random Forest with baseline model
9. Saved trained model using joblib

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Classification Report

## Deliverables
- Notebook
- Feature importance plot
- Saved model (.pkl)

## Interview Questions Covered
- Why accuracy is misleading in fraud detection?
- What is Random Forest?
- What is ensemble learning?
- What is n_estimators?
- What is SMOTE?

## Final Outcome
This task demonstrates ensemble learning and handling imbalanced datasets for fraud detection.
